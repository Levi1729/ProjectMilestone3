{"text": "a A question has been presented to the Board as to whether a loan by a bank to a mutual investment fund is secured    indirectly by margin stock within the meaning of  2213a so that the loan should be treated as subject to this part b Briefly the facts are as follows Fund X an openend investment company entered into a loan agreement with Bank Y which was and still is custodian of the securities which comprise the portfolio of Fund X The agreement includes the following terms which are material to the question before the Board 1 Fund X agrees to have an asset coverage as defined in the agreements of 400 percent of all its borrowings including the proposed borrowing at the time when it takes down any part of the loan 2 Fund X agrees to maintain an asset coverage of at least 300 percent of its borrowings at all times 3 Fund X agrees not to amend its custody agreement with Bank Y or to substitute another custodian without Bank Ys consent 4 Fund X agrees not to mortgage pledge or otherwise encumber any of its assets elsewhere than with Bank Y c In  221109 the Board stated that because of the general nature and operations of such a company any loan by a bank to an openend investment company that customarily purchases margin stock    should be presumed to be subject to this part as a loan for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock purpose credit The Boards interpretation went on to say that this would not be altered by the fact that the openend company had used or proposed to use its own funds or proceeds of the loan to redeem some of its own shares    d Accordingly the loan by Bank Y to Fund X was and is a purpose credit However a loan by a bank is not subject to this part unless it is a purpose credit and it is secured directly or indirectly by margin stock In the present case the loan is not secured directly by stock in the ordinary sense since the portfolio of Fund X is not pledged to secure the credit from Bank Y But the word indirectly must signify some form of security arrangement other than the direct security which arises from the ordinary transaction that gives recourse against a particular chattel or land or against a third party on an obligation described in the American Law Institutes Restatement of the Law of Security page 1 Otherwise the word indirectly would be superfluous and a regulation like a statute must be construed if possible to give meaning to every word e The Board has indicated its view that any arrangement under which margin stock is more readily available as security to the lending bank than to other creditors of the borrower may amount to indirect security within the meaning of this part In an interpretation published at  221110 it stated The Board has long held in the    purpose area that the original purpose of a loan should not be determined upon a narrow analysis of the technical circumstances under which a loan is made     Where security is involved standards of interpretation should be equally searching In its pamphlet issued for the benefit and guidance of banks and bank examiners entitled Questions and Answers Illustrating Application of Regulation U the Board said In determining whether a loan is indirectly secured it should be borne in mind that the reason the Board has thus far refrained    from regulating loans not secured by stock has been to simplify operations under the regulation This objective of simplifying operations does not apply to loans in which arrangements are made to retain the substance of stock collateral while sacrificing only the form f A wide variety of arrangements as to collateral can be made between bank and borrower which will serve to some extent to protect the interest of the bank in seeing that the loan is repaid without giving the bank a conventional direct security interest in the collateral Among such arrangements which have come to the Boards attention are the following 1 The borrower may deposit margin stock in the custody of the bank An arrangement of this kind may not it is true place the bank in the position of a secured creditor in case of bankruptcy or even of conflicting claims but it is likely effectively to strengthen the banks position The definition of indirectly secured in  2212 which provides that a loan is not indirectly secured if the lender holds the margin stock only in the capacity of custodian depositary or trustee or under similar circumstances and in good faith has not relied upon the margin stock as collateral does not exempt a deposit of this kind from the impact of the regulation unless it is clear that the bank has not relied upon the margin stock deposited with it 2 A borrower may not deposit his margin stock with the bank but agree not to pledge or encumber his assets elsewhere while the loan is outstanding Such an agreement may be difficult to police yet it serves to some extent to protect the interest of the bank if only because the future credit standing and business reputation of the borrower will depend upon his keeping his word If the assets covered by such an agreement include margin stock then the credit is indirectly secured by the margin stock within the meaning of this part 3 The borrower may deposit margin stock with a third party who agrees to hold the stock until the loan has been paid off Here even though the parties may purport to provide that the stock is not security for the loan for example by agreeing that the stock may not be sold and the proceeds applied to the debt if the borrower fails to pay the mere fact that the stock is out of the borrowers control for the duration of the loan serves to some extent to protect the bank g The three instances described in paragraph f of this section are merely illustrative Other methods or combinations of methods may serve a similar purpose The conclusion that any given arrangement makes a credit indirectly secured by margin stock may but need not be reinforced by facts such as that the stock in question was purchased with proceeds of the loan that the lender suggests or insists upon the arrangement or that the loan would probably be subject to criticism by supervisory authorities were it not for the protective arrangement h Accordingly the Board concludes that the loan by Bank Y to Fund X is indirectly secured by the portfolio of the fund and must be treated by the bank as a regulated loan"}
{"text": "a A question has been raised concerning the applicability of provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to the acquisition by a bank holding company of stock of a small business investment company SBIC organized pursuant to the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 SBI Act  b As indicated in the interpretation of the Board  225107 published at 23 FR 7813 it is the Boards opinion that since stock of an SBIC is eligible for purchase by national banks and since section 4c4 of the Holding Company Act exempts stock eligible for investment by national banks from the prohibitions of section 4 of that Act a bank holding company may lawfully acquire stock in such an SBIC  c However section 304 of the SBI Act provides that debentures of a small business concern purchased by a small business investment company may be converted at the option of such company into stock of the small business concern The question therefore arises as to whether in the event of such conversion the parent bank holding company would be regarded as having acquired direct or indirect ownership or control of stock of the small business concern in violation of section 4a of the Holding Company Act  d The Small Business Investment Act clearly contemplates that one of the primary purposes of that Act was to enable SBICs to provide needed equity capital to small business concerns through the purchase of debentures convertible into stock Thus to the extent that a stockholder in an SBIC might acquire indirect control of stock of a small business concern such control appears to be a natural and contemplated incident of ownership of stock of the SBIC The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has informally indicated concurrence with this interpretation insofar as it affects investments by national banks in stock of an SBIC  e Since the exception as to stock eligible for investment by national banks contained in section 4c4 of the Holding Company Act was apparently intended to permit a bank holding company to acquire any stock that would be eligible for purchase by a national bank it is the Boards view that section 4a1 of the Act does not prohibit a bank holding company from acquiring stock of an SBIC even though ownership of such stock may result in the acquisition of indirect ownership or control of stock of a small business concern which would not itself be eligible for purchase directly by a national bank or a bank holding company "}
