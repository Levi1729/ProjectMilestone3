{"text": "a A question has been presented to the Board as to whether a loan by a bank to a mutual investment fund is secured    indirectly by margin stock within the meaning of  2213a so that the loan should be treated as subject to this part b Briefly the facts are as follows Fund X an openend investment company entered into a loan agreement with Bank Y which was and still is custodian of the securities which comprise the portfolio of Fund X The agreement includes the following terms which are material to the question before the Board 1 Fund X agrees to have an asset coverage as defined in the agreements of 400 percent of all its borrowings including the proposed borrowing at the time when it takes down any part of the loan 2 Fund X agrees to maintain an asset coverage of at least 300 percent of its borrowings at all times 3 Fund X agrees not to amend its custody agreement with Bank Y or to substitute another custodian without Bank Ys consent 4 Fund X agrees not to mortgage pledge or otherwise encumber any of its assets elsewhere than with Bank Y c In  221109 the Board stated that because of the general nature and operations of such a company any loan by a bank to an openend investment company that customarily purchases margin stock    should be presumed to be subject to this part as a loan for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock purpose credit The Boards interpretation went on to say that this would not be altered by the fact that the openend company had used or proposed to use its own funds or proceeds of the loan to redeem some of its own shares    d Accordingly the loan by Bank Y to Fund X was and is a purpose credit However a loan by a bank is not subject to this part unless it is a purpose credit and it is secured directly or indirectly by margin stock In the present case the loan is not secured directly by stock in the ordinary sense since the portfolio of Fund X is not pledged to secure the credit from Bank Y But the word indirectly must signify some form of security arrangement other than the direct security which arises from the ordinary transaction that gives recourse against a particular chattel or land or against a third party on an obligation described in the American Law Institutes Restatement of the Law of Security page 1 Otherwise the word indirectly would be superfluous and a regulation like a statute must be construed if possible to give meaning to every word e The Board has indicated its view that any arrangement under which margin stock is more readily available as security to the lending bank than to other creditors of the borrower may amount to indirect security within the meaning of this part In an interpretation published at  221110 it stated The Board has long held in the    purpose area that the original purpose of a loan should not be determined upon a narrow analysis of the technical circumstances under which a loan is made     Where security is involved standards of interpretation should be equally searching In its pamphlet issued for the benefit and guidance of banks and bank examiners entitled Questions and Answers Illustrating Application of Regulation U the Board said In determining whether a loan is indirectly secured it should be borne in mind that the reason the Board has thus far refrained    from regulating loans not secured by stock has been to simplify operations under the regulation This objective of simplifying operations does not apply to loans in which arrangements are made to retain the substance of stock collateral while sacrificing only the form f A wide variety of arrangements as to collateral can be made between bank and borrower which will serve to some extent to protect the interest of the bank in seeing that the loan is repaid without giving the bank a conventional direct security interest in the collateral Among such arrangements which have come to the Boards attention are the following 1 The borrower may deposit margin stock in the custody of the bank An arrangement of this kind may not it is true place the bank in the position of a secured creditor in case of bankruptcy or even of conflicting claims but it is likely effectively to strengthen the banks position The definition of indirectly secured in  2212 which provides that a loan is not indirectly secured if the lender holds the margin stock only in the capacity of custodian depositary or trustee or under similar circumstances and in good faith has not relied upon the margin stock as collateral does not exempt a deposit of this kind from the impact of the regulation unless it is clear that the bank has not relied upon the margin stock deposited with it 2 A borrower may not deposit his margin stock with the bank but agree not to pledge or encumber his assets elsewhere while the loan is outstanding Such an agreement may be difficult to police yet it serves to some extent to protect the interest of the bank if only because the future credit standing and business reputation of the borrower will depend upon his keeping his word If the assets covered by such an agreement include margin stock then the credit is indirectly secured by the margin stock within the meaning of this part 3 The borrower may deposit margin stock with a third party who agrees to hold the stock until the loan has been paid off Here even though the parties may purport to provide that the stock is not security for the loan for example by agreeing that the stock may not be sold and the proceeds applied to the debt if the borrower fails to pay the mere fact that the stock is out of the borrowers control for the duration of the loan serves to some extent to protect the bank g The three instances described in paragraph f of this section are merely illustrative Other methods or combinations of methods may serve a similar purpose The conclusion that any given arrangement makes a credit indirectly secured by margin stock may but need not be reinforced by facts such as that the stock in question was purchased with proceeds of the loan that the lender suggests or insists upon the arrangement or that the loan would probably be subject to criticism by supervisory authorities were it not for the protective arrangement h Accordingly the Board concludes that the loan by Bank Y to Fund X is indirectly secured by the portfolio of the fund and must be treated by the bank as a regulated loan"}
{"text": "a A question has been raised concerning the applicability of provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to the acquisition by a bank holding company of stock of a small business investment company SBIC organized pursuant to the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 SBI Act  b As indicated in the interpretation of the Board  225107 published at 23 FR 7813 it is the Boards opinion that since stock of an SBIC is eligible for purchase by national banks and since section 4c4 of the Holding Company Act exempts stock eligible for investment by national banks from the prohibitions of section 4 of that Act a bank holding company may lawfully acquire stock in such an SBIC  c However section 304 of the SBI Act provides that debentures of a small business concern purchased by a small business investment company may be converted at the option of such company into stock of the small business concern The question therefore arises as to whether in the event of such conversion the parent bank holding company would be regarded as having acquired direct or indirect ownership or control of stock of the small business concern in violation of section 4a of the Holding Company Act  d The Small Business Investment Act clearly contemplates that one of the primary purposes of that Act was to enable SBICs to provide needed equity capital to small business concerns through the purchase of debentures convertible into stock Thus to the extent that a stockholder in an SBIC might acquire indirect control of stock of a small business concern such control appears to be a natural and contemplated incident of ownership of stock of the SBIC The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has informally indicated concurrence with this interpretation insofar as it affects investments by national banks in stock of an SBIC  e Since the exception as to stock eligible for investment by national banks contained in section 4c4 of the Holding Company Act was apparently intended to permit a bank holding company to acquire any stock that would be eligible for purchase by a national bank it is the Boards view that section 4a1 of the Act does not prohibit a bank holding company from acquiring stock of an SBIC even though ownership of such stock may result in the acquisition of indirect ownership or control of stock of a small business concern which would not itself be eligible for purchase directly by a national bank or a bank holding company "}

{"text": "a An inquiry was presented recently concerning the application of this part or part 221 of this subchapter to a plan proposed by a Federal credit union to aid its members in purchasing stock of a corporation whose subsidiary apparently was the employer of all the credit unions members  b From the information submitted the plan appeared to contemplate that the Federal credit union would accept orders from its members for registered common stock of the parent corporation in multiples of 5 shares that whenever orders had been so received for a total of 100 shares the credit union as agent for such members would execute the orders through a brokerage firm with membership on a national securities exchange that the brokerage firm would deliver certificates for the stock registered in the names of the individual purchasers to the credit union against payment by the credit union that the credit union would prorate the total amount so paid including the brokerage fee among the individual purchasers according to the number of shares purchased by them and that a savings in brokerage fee resulting from the 100lot purchases would be passed on by the credit union to the individual purchasers of the stock However amounts of the stock less than 100 shares would be purchased by the credit union through the brokerage firm for any members willing to forego such savings  c It appeared further that the Federal credit union members for whom stock was so purchased would reimburse the credit union 1 by cash payment 2 by the proceeds of withdrawn shares of the credit union 3 by the proceeds of an installment loan from the credit union collateraled by the stock purchased or by 4 by a combination of two or more of the above methods To assist the collection of any such loan the employer of the credit union members would provide payroll deductions Apparently sales by the credit union of any of the stock purchased by one of its members would occur only in satisfaction of a delinquent loan balance In no case did it appear that the credit union would make a charge for arranging the execution of transactions in the stock for its members  d The Board was of the view that from the facts as presented it did not appear that the Federal credit union should be regarded as the type of institution to which part 221 of this subchapter in its present form applied  e With respect to this part the question was whether the activities of the Federal credit union under the proposal or otherwise might be such as to bring it within the meaning of the terms broker or dealer as used in the part and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 The Board observed that this of course was a question of fact that necessarily depended upon the circumstances of the particular case including the manner in which the arrangement in question might be carried out in practice  f On the basis of the information submitted however it did not appear to the Board that the Federal credit union should be regarded as being subject to this part as a broker or dealer who transacts a business in securities through the medium of a member firm solely because of its activities as contemplated by the proposal in question The Board stated that the part rather clearly would not apply if there appeared to be nothing other than loans by the credit union to its members to finance purchases made directly by them of stock of the parent corporation of the employer of the memberborrowers The additional fact that the credit union as agent would purchase such stock for its members even though all such purchases might not be financed by credit union loans was not viewed by the Board as sufficient to make the regulation applicable where as from the facts presented it did not appear that the credit union in any case was to make any charge or receive any compensation for assisting in such purchases or that the credit union otherwise was engaged in securities activities However the Board stated that matters of this kind must be examined closely for any variations that might suggest the inapplicability of the foregoing "}

address of the organization information sufficient to identify the agreement and a statement that the organization received 15000 during the year In addition since the organization allocated and used

include the name and address of the group information sufficient to identify the agreement and a statement that the group received 50000 Because the group did not allocate and use all of the funds for

report also could state that it used 5000 for a particular business trip and include a brief description of the trip  iv Example 4 A community development organization is a party to two separate

does not include information for all of the required categories listed in this part the NGEP must report the total expenditures in the remaining categories either by providing that information directly or by providing another form or report that includes the required information ii Examples 2 An organization receives 15000 from an insured depository institution under a covered agreement and allocates and uses the 15000 during the fiscal year to purchase computer equipment to support its functions The organizations annual report must include the name and address of the organization information sufficient to identify the agreement and a statement that the organization received 15000 during the year In addition since the organization allocated and used the funds for a specific purpose that is more narrow and limited than the categories of expenses included in the detailed itemized list of expenses the organization would have the option of providing either the total amount it used during the year for each category of expenses included in paragraph d1iv of this section or a statement that it used the 15000 to purchase computer equipment and a brief description of the equipment purchased iii Examples 3 A community group receives 50000 from an insured depository institution under a covered agreement During its fiscal year the community group specifically allocates and uses 5000 of the funds to pay for a particular business trip and uses the remaining 45000 for general operating expenses The groups annual report for the fiscal year must include the name and address of the group information sufficient to identify the agreement and a statement that the group received 50000 Because the group did not allocate and use all of the funds for a specific purpose the groups annual report must provide the total amount of funds it used during the year for each category of expenses included in paragraph d1iv of this section The groups annual report also could state that it used 5000 for a particular business trip and include a brief description of the trip iv Example 4 A community development organization is a party to two separate covered agreements with two unaffiliated insured depository institutions Under each agreement the organization receives 15000 during its fiscal year and uses the funds to support its activities during that year If the organization elects to file a consolidated annual report the consolidated report must identify the organization and the two covered agreements state that the organization received 15000 during the fiscal year under each agreement and provide the total amount that the organization used during the year for each category of expenses included in paragraph d1iv of this section e Annual report filed by insured depository institution or affiliate  1 General The annual report filed by an insured depository institution or affiliate must include the following   i The name and principal place of

{"text": "a Applicability 1 This section applies to all depository institution holding companies that are organized as legal entities other than stock corporations and that are subject to this part Regulation Q 12 CFR part 2171FTREF 1 See 12 CFR 2171c1 through 3 2 Notwithstanding  2172 and 21710 a bank holding company or covered savings and loan holding company that is organized as a legal entity other than a stock corporation and has issued capital instruments that do not qualify as common equity tier 1 capital under  21720 by virtue of the requirements set forth in this section may treat those capital instruments as common equity tier 1 capital until July 1 2016 b Common equity tier 1 capital criteria applied to capital instruments issued by nonstock companies 1 Subpart C of this part provides criteria for capital instruments to qualify as common equity tier 1 capital This section describes how certain criteria apply to capital instruments issued by bank holding companies and covered savings and loan holding companies that are organized as legal entities other than stock corporations such as limited liability companies LLCs and partnerships 2 Holding companies are organized using a variety of legal structures including corporate forms LLCs partnerships and similar structures2FTREF In the Boards experience some depository institution holding companies that are organized in nonstock form issue multiple classes of capital instruments that allocate profit and loss from a distribution differently among classes which may affect the ability of those classes to qualify as common equity tier 1 capital3FTREF 2 A stock corporations common stock should satisfy the CET1 criteria so long as the common stock does not have unusual features such as a limited duration 3 Notably voting powers or other means of exercising control are not relevant for purposes of satisfying the CET1 eligibility criteria Thus the fact that a particular partner or member controls a holding company for instance due to serving as general partner or managing member is not material to qualification of particular interests as CET1 3 Common equity tier 1 capital is defined in  21720b To qualify as common equity tier 1 capital capital instruments must satisfy a number of criteria This section provides examples of the application of certain common equity tier 1 capital criteria that relate to the economic interests in the company represented by particular capital instruments c Examples The following examples show how the criteria for common equity tier 1 capital apply to particular partnership or LLC structures4FTREF 4 Although the examples refer to specific types of legal entities for purposes of illustration the substance of the Regulation Q criteria reflected in the examples applies to all types of legal entities 1 LLC with one class of membership interests i An LLC issues one class of membership interests that provides that all holders of the interests bear losses and receive dividends proportionate to their levels of ownership ii Provided that the other criteria in  21720b are met the membership interests would qualify as common equity tier 1 capital 2 Partnership with limited and general partners i A partnership has two classes of interests General partnership interests and limited partnership interests The general partners and the limited partners bear losses and receive distributions allocated proportionately to their capital contributions In addition the general partner has unlimited liability for the debts of the partnership ii Provided that the other criteria in  21720b are met the general and limited partnership interests would qualify as common equity tier 1 capital The fact of unlimited liability of the general partner is not relevant in the context of the eligibility criteria of common equity tier 1 capital instruments provided that the general partner and limited partners share losses equally to the extent of the assets of the partnership and the general partner is liable after the assets of the partnership are exhausted In this regard the general partners unlimited liability is similar to a guarantee provided by the general partner rather than a feature of the general partnership interest 3 Senior and junior classes of capital instruments i An LLC issues two types of membership interests Class A and Class B Holders of Class A and Class B interests participate equally in operating distributions and have equal voting rights However in liquidation holders of Class B interests must receive the entire amount of their contributed capital in order for any distributions to be made to holders of Class A interests ii Class B interests have a preference over Class A interests in liquidation and therefore would not qualify as common equity tier 1 capital as the Class B interests are not the most subordinated claim criterion i and do not share losses proportionately criterion viii  21720b1i and viii respectively A If all other criteria are satisfied Class A interests would qualify as common equity tier 1 capital B Class B interests may qualify as additional tier 1 capital or tier 2 capital if the Class B interests meet the applicable criteria  21720c and d 4 LLC with two classes of membership interests i An LLC issues two types of membership interests Class A and Class B To the extent that the LLC makes a distribution holders of Class A and Class B interests share proportionately in any losses and receive proportionate shares of contributed capital To the extent that a capital distribution includes an allocation of profits holders of Class A and Class B interests share proportionately up to the point where all holders receive a specific annual rate of return on capital contributions and if the distribution exceeds that point holders of Class B interests receive double their proportional share and holders of Class A interests receive the remainder of the distribution ii Class A and Class B interests would both qualify as common equity tier 1 capital provided that under all circumstances they share losses proportionately as measured with respect to each distribution and that they satisfy the common equity tier 1 capital criteria The holders of Class A and Class B interests may receive different allocations of profits with respect to a distribution provided that the distribution is made simultaneously to all members of Class A and Class B interests Despite the potential for disproportionate profits Class A and Class B interests have the same level of seniority with regard to potential losses and therefore they both satisfy all the criteria in  21720b including criterion ii  21720b1ii 5 Alternative LLC with two classes of membership interests i An LLC issues two types of membership interests Class A and Class B In the event that the LLC makes a distribution holders of Class A interests bear a disproportionately low level of any losses such that the Class B interests bear a disproportionately high level of losses at the distribution In contrast to the example in paragraph c4 of this section the different participation rights apply to distributions in situations where losses are allocated including losses at liquidation ii Because holders of the Class A interests do not bear a proportional interest in the losses criterion ii  21720b1ii the Class A interests would not qualify as common equity tier 1 capital A Companies with such structures may revise their capital structures in order to provide for a sufficiently large class of capital instruments that proportionally bear first losses in liquidation that is the Class B interests in this example B Alternatively companies with such structures could revise their capital structure to ensure that all classes of capital instruments that are intended to qualify as common equity tier 1 capital share equally in losses in liquidation consistent with criteria i ii vii and viii in  21720b1i ii vii respectively even if each class of capital instruments has different rights to allocations of profits as in paragraph c4 of this section 6 Mandatory distributions i A partnership agreement contains provisions that require distributions to holders of one or more classes of capital instruments on the occurrence of particular events such as upon specific dates or following a significant sale of assets but not including any final distributions in liquidation ii Any class of capital instruments that provides holders with rights to mandatory distributions would not qualify as common equity tier 1 capital because a holding company must have full discretion at all times to refrain from paying any dividends and making any other distributions on the instrument without triggering an event of default a requirement to make a paymentinkind or an imposition of any other restriction on the holding company criterion vi in  21720b1vi Companies must ensure that they have a sufficient amount of capital instruments that do not have such rights and that meet the other criteria of common equity tier 1 capital in order to meet the requirements of Regulation Q 7 Features that Reallocate Prior Distributions i An LLC issues two types of membership interests Class A and Class B The terms of the LLCs membership interests provide that under certain circumstances holders of Class A interests must return a portion of earlier distributions which are then distributed to holders of Class B interests sometimes called a clawback ii If the reallocation of prior distributions described in paragraph c7i of this section could result in holders of the Class B interests bearing fewer losses on an aggregate basis than Class A interests the Class B interests would not qualify as common equity tier 1 capital However where the membership interests provide for disproportionate allocation of profits such as described in the example in paragraph c4 of this section and the reallocation of prior distributions would be limited to reversing the disproportionate portions of prior distributions both the Class A and Class B interests could qualify as common equity tier 1 capital provided that they met all the other criteria in  21720b"}

{"text": "a Application for specific terms  1 In general A person is not required to provide a riskbased pricing notice to the consumer under  22272a or c if the consumer applies for specific material

as an annual percentage rate that may be 8 10 or 12 percent or between 8 and 12 percent 2 Example A consumer receives a firm offer of credit from a credit card issuer The terms of the firm offer are based in whole or in part on information from a consumer report that the credit card issuer obtained under the FCRAs firm offer of credit provisions The solicitation offers the consumer a credit card with a single purchase annual percentage rate of 12 percent The consumer applies for and receives a credit card with an annual percentage rate of 12 percent Other customers with the same credit card have a purchase annual percentage rate of 10 percent The exception applies because the consumer applied for specific material terms and was granted those terms Although the credit card issuer specified the annual percentage rate in the firm offer of credit based in whole or in part on a consumer report the credit card issuer specified that material term before not after the consumer applied for or requested credit b Adverse action notice A person is not required to provide a riskbased pricing notice to the consumer under  22272a c or d if the person provides an adverse action

consumers with low credit scores The issuer mails a firm offer of credit to the high credit score consumers with a single purchase annual percentage rate of 10 percent The issuer also mails a firm offer of credit to the low credit score consumers with a single purchase annual percentage rate of 14 percent The credit card issuer is not required to provide a riskbased pricing notice to the low

has been paid as well as payment of the full amount of anticipated fees before processing your request f Interest FHFA may charge you interest on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st calendar day following the day on which the bill was sent Once a fee payment has been received by FHFA even if not processed FHFA will stay the accrual of interest Interest charges will be assessed at the rate prescribed by 31 USC 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing g FHFA assistance to reduce costs If FHFA notifies you of estimated fees exceeding 10000 or requests advance payment or a deposit you will have an opportunity to consult with FHFA FOIA staff to modify or reformulate your request to meet your needs at a lower cost h Fee waiver requests You may request a fee waiver in accordance with the FOIA and this regulation Requests for a waiver of fees must be made in writing and should be made at the time you submit your FOIA request However your fee waiver may be submitted at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal FHFA may grant your fee waiver request or a reduction of fees if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Federal Government and is not primarily in your commercial interest In submitting a fee waiver request you must address the following six factors   1 Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the Federal Government The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear not remote or attenuated 2 Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of Federal Government operations or activities This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met i Disclosure of the requested information must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain in either the same or a substantially identical form would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the publics understanding and ii The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject as opposed to your individual understanding Your expertise in the subject area as well as your ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered FHFA will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration 3 The disclosure must not be primarily in your commercial interest To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in your commercial interest FHFA will consider the following criteria i FHFA will determine whether you have any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure A commercial interest includes any commercial trade or profit interest You will be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration and ii If there is an identified commercial interest FHFA will determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request i Fee Waiver determination FHFA will notify you within 20 days of receipt of your request whether the fee waiver has been granted Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees a waiver will be granted for those records For those records that do not satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees you may be charged for those records When you have committed to pay fees and subsequently ask for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied you must pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received A request for fee waiver that is denied may only be appealed when a final decision has been made on the initial FOIA request j Restrictions on charging fees 1 When FHFA determines that you are an educational institution noncommercial scientific institution or representative of the news media and the records are not sought for commercial use FHFA will not charge search fees 2i If FHFA fails to comply with the FOIAs time limits in which to respond to your request FHFA will not charge search fees or in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph j1 of this section will not charge duplication fees except as described in paragraphs j2ii through iv of this section ii If FHFA has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and FHFA has provided timely written notice to you in accordance with the FOIA FHFAs failure to comply with the time limit will be excused for an additional 10 days iii If FHFA determines that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and more than 5000 pages are necessary to respond to your request FHFA may charge search fees or in the case of a requester described in paragraph j1 of this section may charge duplication fees if the following steps are taken FHFA must have provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to you in accordance with the FOIA and FHFA must have discussed with you via written mail email or telephone or made not less than three goodfaith attempts to do so how you could effectively limit the scope of your request in accordance with 5 USC 552a6Bii If this exception is satisfied FHFA may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request iv If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist as defined by the FOIA a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order 3 No search or review fees will be charged for a quarterhour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review 4 If you seek records for a commercial use FHFA will provide without charge i The first 100 pages of duplication or the cost equivalent for other media and ii The first two hours of search 5 No fee will be charged when the total fee after deducting the 100 free pages or its cost equivalent and the first two hours of search is equal to or less than 2500 k Additional resource The FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA contact is available to assist you in modifying or reformulating a request to meet your needs at a lower cost FHFA will also notify you of the availability of OGIS to provide dispute resolution service"}

shall comply with the stricter margin requirements for any noncleared swap or noncleared securitybased swap entered into with that counterparty after the counterparty changes its status 2 If a covered swap entitys counterparty changes its status such that a noncleared swap or noncleared securitybased swap with that counterparty becomes subject to less strict margin requirements under this subpart such as if the counterpartys status changes from a financial end user with material swaps exposure to a financial end user without material swaps exposure then the covered swap entity may comply with the less strict margin requirements for any noncleared swap or noncleared securitybased swap entered into with that counterparty after the counterparty changes its status as well as for any

swaps Covered swaps entities are required to comply with the requirements of this subpart for noncleared swaps and noncleared securitybased swaps entered into on or after the relevant compliance dates for variation margin and for initial margin established in paragraph e of this section Any noncleared swap or noncleared securitybased swap entered into before such relevant date shall remain outside the scope of this subpart if amendments are made to the noncleared swap or noncleared securitybased swap by method of adherence to a protocol other amendment of a contract or confirmation or execution of a new contract or confirmation in replacement of and immediately upon termination of an existing contract or confirmation as follows 1 Amendments to the noncleared swap or noncleared securitybased swap solely to comply with the requirements of 12 CFR part 47 12 CFR part 252 subpart I or 12 CFR part 382 as applicable 2 The noncleared swap or noncleared security based swap was amended under the following conditions i The swap was originally entered into booked at or otherwise held at an entity located in the United Kingdom before the relevant compliance date established in paragraph e of this section and one party to the swap booked it at or otherwise held it at an entity including a branch or other authorized form of establishment located in the United Kingdom ii The entity in the United Kingdom subsequently arranged to amend the swap solely for the purpose of transferring it to an affiliate or a branch or other authorized form of establishment located in any European Union member state or the United States in connection with the entitys planning for or response to the event described in paragraph h2iii of this section and the transferee is A A covered swap entity or B A covered swap entitys counterparty to the swap and the counterparty represents to the covered swap entity that the counterparty performed the transfer in compliance with the requirements of paragraphs h2i and ii of this section subject to the following conditions iii The law of the European Union ceases to apply to the United Kingdom pursuant to Article 503 of the Treaty on European Union without conclusion of a Withdrawal Agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union pursuant to Article 502 iv The amendments do not modify any of the following The payment amount calculation methods the maturity date or the notional amount of the swap or noncleared swap v The amendments cause the transfer to take effect on or after the date of the event described in paragraph h2iii of this section transpires and vi The amendments cause the transfer to take effect by the later of A The date that is one year after the date of the event described in paragraph h2iii of this section or B Such other date permitted by transitional provisions under Article 35 of Commission Delegated Regulation EU No 20162251 as amended 3i Amendments to the noncleared swap or noncleared securitybased swap that are made solely to accommodate the replacement of A An interbank offered rate IBOR including but not limited to the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate TIBOR the Bank Bill Swap Rate BBSW the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate SIBOR the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate CDOR Euro Interbank Offered Rate EURIBOR and the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate HIBOR B Any other interest rate that a covered swap entity reasonably expects to be replaced or discontinued or reasonably determines has lost its relevance as a reliable benchmark due to a significant impairment or C Any other interest rate that succeeds a rate referenced in paragraph h3iA or B of this section An amendment made under this paragraph h3iC could be one of multiple amendments made under this paragraph h3iC For example an amendment could replace an IBOR with a temporary interest rate and later replace the temporary interest rate with a permanent interest rate ii Amendments to accommodate replacement of an interest rate described in paragraph h3i of this section may also incorporate spreads or other adjustments to the replacement interest rate and make other necessary technical changes to operationalize the determination of payments or other exchanges of economic value using the replacement interest rate including changes to determination dates calculation agents and payment dates The changes may not have a longer maturity or increase the total effective notional amount of the noncleared swap or noncleared securitybased swap beyond what is necessary to accommodate the differences between market conventions for an outgoing interest rate and its replacement iii Amendments to accommodate replacement of an interest rate described in paragraph h3i of this section may also be effectuated through portfolio compression between or among covered swap entities and their counterparties Portfolio compression under this paragraph is not subject to the limitations in

amount more than what is necessary to accommodate the differences between market conventions for an outgoing interest rate and its replacement 4 Amendments solely to reduce risk or remain riskneutral through portfolio compression between or among covered swap entities and their counterparties as long as any noncleared swaps or noncleared securitybased swaps resulting from the portfolio compression do not i Exceed the sum of the total effective notional amounts of all of the swaps that were submitted to the compression exercise that had the same or longer remaining maturity as the resulting swap or ii Exceed the longest remaining maturity of all the swaps submitted to the compression exercise 5 The noncleared swap or noncleared securitybased swap was amended solely for one of the following reasons i To reflect technical changes such as addresses identities of parties for delivery of formal notices and other administrative or operational provisions as long as they do not alter the noncleared swaps or noncleared securitybased swaps underlying asset or reference the remaining maturity or the total effective notional amount or ii To reduce the notional amount so long as A All payment obligations attached to the total effective notional amount being eliminated as a result of the amendment are fully terminated or B All payment obligations attached to the total effective notional amount being eliminated as a result of the amendment are fully novated to a third party who complies with applicable margin rules for the novated portion upon the transfer"}

{"text": "a Authority Under section 19a of the Federal Reserve Act 12 USC 461a the Board is authorized to define terms used in section 19 and to prescribe regulations to implement and to prevent evasions of the requirements of that section Section 19b2 establishes general reserve requirements on transaction accounts and nonpersonal time deposits In addition to its authority to define terms under section 19a section 19g of the Federal Reserve Act also give the Board the specific authority to define terms relating to deductions allowed in reserve computation including balances due from other banks This interpretation is adopted under these authorities b Background 1 Currently the Board requires reserves of zero three or ten percent on transaction accounts depending upon the amount of transaction deposits in the depository institution and of zero percent on nonpersonal time deposits In determining its reserve balance under Regulation D a depository institution may deduct the balances it maintains in another depository institution located in the United States if those balances are subject to immediate withdrawal by the depositing depository institution  2043f This deduction is commonly known as the due from deduction In addition Regulation D at  2042a1viiA exempts from the definition of deposit any liability of a depository institution on a promissory note or similar obligation that is issued or undertaken and held for the account of an office located in the United States of another depository institution Transactions falling within this exemption from the definition of deposit include federal funds or fed funds transactions  2 Under section 19b2 of the Federal Reserve Act 12 USC 461b2 the Board is required to impose reserves of three percent on total transaction deposits at or below an amount determined under a formula Transaction deposits falling within this amount are in the low reserve tranche Currently the low reserve tranche runs up to 422 million Under section 19b11 of the Federal Reserve Act 12 USC 461b11 the Board is also required to impose reserves of zero percent on reservable liabilities at or below an amount determined under a formula Currently that amount is 36 million c Shifting funds between depository institutions The Board is aware that certain depository institutions with transaction account balances in an amount greater than the low reserve tranche have entered into transactions with affiliated depository institutions that have transaction account balances below the maximum low reserve tranche amount These transactions are intended to lower the transaction reserves of the larger depository institution and leave the economic position of the smaller depository institutions unaffected and have no apparent purpose other than to reduce required reserves of the larger institution The larger depository institution places funds in a demand deposit at a small domestic depository institution The larger depository institution considers those funds to be subject to the due from deduction and accordingly reduces its transaction reserves in the amount of the demand deposit The larger depository institution then reduces its transaction account reserves by 10 percent of the deposited amount The small depository institution because it is within the low reserve tranche must maintain transaction account reserves of 3 percent on the funds deposited by the larger depository institution The small depository institution then transfers all but 3 percent of the funds deposited by the larger depository institution back to the larger depository institution in a transaction that qualifies as a fed funds transaction The 3 percent not transferred to the larger depository institution is the amount of the larger depository institutions deposit that the small depository institution must maintain as transaction account reserves Because the larger depository institution books this second part of the transaction as a fed funds transaction the larger depository institution does not maintain reserves on the funds that it receives back from the small depository institution As a consequence the larger depository institution has available for its use 97 percent of the amount transferred to the small depository institution Had the larger depository institution not entered into the transaction it would have maintained transaction account reserves of 10 percent on that amount and would have had only 90 percent of that amount for use in its business d Determination The Board believes that the practice described above generally is a device to evade the reserves imposed by Regulation D Consequently the Board has determined that in the circumstances described above the larger depository institution depositing funds in the smaller institution may not take a due from deduction on account of the funds in the demand deposit account if and to the extent that funds flow back to the larger depository institution from the small depository institution by means of a transaction that is exempt from transaction account reserve requirements"}

{"text": "a Background In 1982 the Board issued an interpretation concerning the effect of a member banks purchase of its own time deposits in the secondary market in order to ensure compliance with regulatory restrictions on the payment of interest on time deposits with the prohibition against payment of interest on demand deposits and with regulatory requirements designed to distinguish between time deposits and demand deposits for federal reserve requirement purposes 47 FR 37878 Aug 27 1982 The interpretation was designed to ensure that the regulatory early withdrawal penalties in Regulation Q used to achieve these three purposes were not evaded through the purchase by a member bank or its affiliate of a time deposit of the member bank prior to the maturity of the deposit  b Because the expiration of the Depository Institutions Deregulation Act title II of Pub L 96221 on April 1 1986 removed the authority to set interest rate ceilings on deposits one of the purposes for adopting the interpretation was eliminated The removal of the authority to set interest rate ceilings on deposits required the Board to revise the early withdrawal penalties which were also used to distinguish between types of deposits for reserve requirement purposes Effective April 1 1986 the Board amended its Regulation D to incorporate early withdrawal penalties applicable to all depository institutions for this purpose 51 FR 9629 Mar 20 1986 Although the new early withdrawal penalties differ from the penalties used to enforce interest rate ceilings secondary market purchases still effectively shorten the maturities of deposits and may be used to evade reserve requirements This interpretation replaces the prior interpretation and states the application of the new early withdrawal penalties to purchases by depository institutions and their affiliates of the depository institutions time deposits The interpretation applies only to situations in which the Boards regulatory penalties apply  c Secondary market purchases under the rule The Board has determined that a depository institution purchasing a time deposit it has issued should be regarded as having paid the time deposit prior to maturity The effect of the transaction is that the depository institution has cancelled a liability as opposed to having acquired an asset for its portfolio Thus the depository institution is required to impose any early withdrawal penalty required by Regulation D on the party from whom it purchases the instrument by deducting the amount of the penalty from the purchase price The Board recognizes however that secondary market sales of time deposits are often done without regard to the identity of the original owner of the deposit Such sales typically involve a pool of time deposits with the price based on the aggregate face value and average rate of return on the deposits A depository institution purchasing time deposits from persons other than the person to whom the deposit was originally issued should be aware of the parties named on each of the deposits it is purchasing but through failure to inspect the deposits prior to the purchase may not be aware at the time it purchases a pool of time deposits that it originally issued one or more of the deposits in the pool In such cases if a purchasing depository institution does not wish to assess an applicable early withdrawal penalty the deposit may be sold immediately in the secondary market as an alternative to imposing the early withdrawal penalty  d Purchases by affiliates On a consolidated basis if an affiliate as defined in  2042q of Regulation D of a depository institution purchases a CD issued by the depository institution the purchase does not reduce their consolidated liabilities and could be accomplished primarily to assist the depository institution in avoiding the requirements of the Boards Regulation D Because the effect of the early withdrawal penalty rule could be easily circumvented by purchases of time deposits by affiliates such purchases are also regarded as an early withdrawals of the time deposit and the purchase should be treated as if the depository institution made the purchase directly Thus the regulatory requirements for early withdrawal penalties apply to affiliates of a depository institution as well as to the institution itself  e Depository institution acting as broker The Board believes that it is permissible for a depository institution to facilitate the secondary market for its own time deposits by finding a purchaser for a time deposit that a customer is trying to sell In such instances the depository institution will not be paying out any of its own funds and the depositor does not have a guarantee that the depository institution will actually be able to find a buyer  f Thirdparty marketmakers A depository institution may also establish and advertise arrangements whereby an unaffiliated third party agrees in advance to purchase time deposits issued by the institution The Board would not regard these transactions as inconsistent with the purposes that the early withdrawal penalty is intended to serve unless a depository institution pays a fee to the third party purchaser as compensation for making the purchases or to remove the risk from purchasing the deposits In this regard any interim financing provided to such a third party by a depository institution in connection with the institutions secondary market activity involving the institutions time deposits must be made substantially on the same terms including interest rates and collateral as those prevailing at the same time for comparable transactions with other similarly situated persons and may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment  g Reciprocal arrangements Finally while a depository institution may enter into an arrangement with an unaffiliated third party wherein the third party agrees to stand ready to purchase time deposits held by the depository institutions customers the Board will regard a reciprocal arrangement with another depository institution for purchase of each others time deposits as a circumvention of the early withdrawal penalty rule and the purposes it is designed to serve "}
