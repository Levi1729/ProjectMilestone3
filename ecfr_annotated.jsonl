extreme but plausible market conditions ii If it operates as a central counterparty may be directed by the Board to maintain additional prefunded financial resources that are sufficient to cover its credit exposure under a wide range of significantly different stress scenarios that includes the default of the two participants and their affiliates that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure to the designated financial market utility in extreme but plausible market conditions The Board may consider such a direction if the central counterparty   A Is involved in activities with a morecomplex risk profile such as clearing financial instruments characterized by discrete jumptodefault price changes or that are highly correlated with potential participant defaults or B Has been determined by another jurisdiction to be systemically important in that jurisdiction iii If it operates as a central counterparty determines the amount and regularly tests the sufficiency of the total financial resources available to meet the requirements of this paragraph by   A On a daily basis conducting a stress test of its total financial resources using standard and predetermined stress scenarios parameters and assumptions B On at least a monthly basis and more frequently when the products cleared or markets served experience high volatility or become less liquid or when the size or concentration of positions held by the central counterpartys participants increases significantly conducting a comprehensive and thorough analysis of the existing stress scenarios models and underlying parameters and assumptions such that the designated financial market utility meets its required level of default protection in light of current and evolving market conditions and C Having

Establishes rules and procedures that explicitly   A Address allocation of credit losses the designated financial market utility may face if its collateral and other financial resources are insufficient to cover fully its credit exposures including the repayment of any funds a designated financial market utility may borrow from liquidity providers and B Describe the designated financial market utilitys process to replenish any financial resources that the designated financial market utility may employ during a stress event including a participant default 5 Collateral If it requires collateral to manage its or its participants credit exposure the designated financial market utility accepts collateral with low credit liquidity and market risks and sets and enforces conservative haircuts and concentration limits in order to ensure the value of the collateral in the event of liquidation and that the collateral can be used in a timely manner In this regard the designated financial market utility   i Establishes prudent valuation practices and develops haircuts that are tested regularly and take into account stressed market conditions ii Establishes haircuts that are calibrated to include relevant periods of stressed market conditions to reduce the need for procyclical adjustments iii Provides for annual validation of its haircut procedures as part of its riskmanagement model validation under paragraph a4v of this section iv Avoids concentrated holdings of any particular type of asset where the concentration could significantly impair the ability to liquidate such assets quickly without significant adverse price effects v Uses a collateral management system that is welldesigned and operationally flexible such that it among other things   A Accommodates changes in the ongoing monitoring and management of collateral and B Allows for the timely valuation of collateral and execution of any collateral or margin calls 6 Margin If it operates as a central counterparty the designated financial market utility covers its credit exposures to its participants for all products by establishing a riskbased margin system that   i Is conceptually and methodologically sound for the risks and particular attributes of each product portfolio and markets it serves as demonstrated by documented and empirical evidence supporting design choices methods used variables selected theoretical bases key assumptions and limitations ii Establishes margin levels commensurate with the risks and particular attributes of each product portfolio and market it serves iii Has a reliable source of timely price data iv Has procedures and sound valuation models for addressing circumstances in which pricing data are not readily available or reliable v Marks participant positions to market and collects variation margin at least daily and has the operational capacity to make intraday margin calls and payments both scheduled and unscheduled to participants vi Generates initial margin requirements sufficient to cover potential changes in the value of each participants position during the interval between the last margin collection and the closeout of positions following a participant default by   A Ensuring that initial margin meets an established singletailed confidence level of at least 99 percent with respect to the estimated distribution of future exposure and B Using a conservative estimate of the time horizons for the effective hedging or closeout of the particular types of products cleared including in stressed market conditions and vii Is monitored on an ongoing basis and regularly reviewed tested and verified through   A Daily backtests B Monthly sensitivity analyses performed more frequently during stressed
